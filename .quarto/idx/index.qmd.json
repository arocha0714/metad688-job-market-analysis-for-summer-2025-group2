Over the next several years, generative AI will become the main focus of AI researchers and enthusiasts. Generative AI is a type of technology that can produce original text, images, and videos. With the rising popularity of generative AI, many companies are faced with the question of how to walk the line between technological advancements and ethical responsibility. Advocates of AI claim that when implemented properly, AI can boost productivity, accelerate product development, and improve business decision-making.

Tech experts hypothesize that industries and sectors such as cybersecurity, financial services, and manufacturing (Expert Panel, 2021) are likely to be affected. On the other hand, some argue that while job displacement is inevitable, AI will also create new jobs. According to Lee, Samanta, and Lee (2024), AI will not eliminate jobs but instead will reshape career structures. Even so, there are still job types that can be at risk of being replaced. An example of a high-risk job would be one that involves repetition and predictable tasks, such as telemarketing and a customer support specialist. On the other hand, the more resilient jobs are those that require emotional intelligence or creative problem-solving. Some examples of these careers are teachers, writers, and employees with skilled trades like plumbers. Another important aspect to consider is that there will be some jobs where AI is used in conjunction with their regular responsibilities; an example of this is teachers. Teachers may use AI to grade papers, but they still will need to perform their regular tasks, like lecturing and mentoring students.
