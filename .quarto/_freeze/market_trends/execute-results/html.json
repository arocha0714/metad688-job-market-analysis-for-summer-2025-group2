In order to do this, we used a count of any jobs containing the word \"analyst\" and categorized them by state. The results of this are shown below.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px;\">\n  Analyst Job Distribution Across the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/analyst_job_distribution.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\n\nAccording to the visual above, Texas and California are the two clear leaders in the total amount of jobs being offered that contain the word \"analyst\" in the title. Additionally, eastern states show a considerably greater amount of these jobs compared to western states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/Avg_salary.html\" title=\"AI vs Non-AI\"></iframe>\n```\nThe chart above displays the salary breakdown between states for job postings impacted and not impacted by AI. The size of the data points illustrates the number of job postings that each state has. Interestingly, both Texas and California have the largest amount of job postings not affected by AI. We can conclude that a possiblity for this is that in those tech hubs, the jobs AI can replace decreased in demand.\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;\">\nAnalyst Job Distribution Across Cities in the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/job_distribution_cities.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\nNew York City is the clear leader in analyst jobs available. Another insight is that Texas has 3 cities in the top 10, which indicates a strong job market.
