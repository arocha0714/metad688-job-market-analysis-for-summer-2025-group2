In order to do this, we used a count of any jobs containing the word \"analyst\" and categorized them by state. The results of this are shown below.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0 40px 0;\">\nAnalyst Job Distribution Across the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/analyst_job_distribution.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\n\nAccording to the visual above, Texas and California are the two clear leaders in the total amount of jobs being offered that contain the word \"analyst\" in the title. Additionally, eastern states show a considerably greater amount of these jobs compared to western states.\n\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;\">\nAnalyst Job Distribution Across Cities in the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/job_distribution_cities.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/salary_distribution_states.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution (with Salaries)\"></iframe>\n```\n\n",
