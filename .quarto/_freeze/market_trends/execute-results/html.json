In order to do this, we used a count of any jobs containing the word \"analyst\" and categorized them by state. The results of this are shown below.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0 40px 0;\">\nAnalyst Job Distribution Across the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/analyst_job_distribution.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\n\nAccording to the visual above, Texas and California are the two clear leaders in the total amount of jobs being offered that contain the word \"analyst\" in the title. Additionally, eastern states show a considerably greater amount of these jobs compared to western states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/Avg_salary.html\" title=\"AI vs Non-AI\"></iframe>\n```\nAs shown above, the range of salaries and AI impact can vary greatly by an individual state.\n\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; margin: 20px 0;\">\nAnalyst Job Distribution Across Cities in the United States\n</div>\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/job_distribution_cities.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution\"></iframe>\n```\nNew York City is the clear leader in analyst jobs available. Another insight is that Texas has 3 cities in the top 10, which indicates a strong job market. Something that surprised us, is that San Francisco finishes lower than expected by rounding out the bottom of the top 10.\n\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/salary_distribution_states.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution (with Salaries)\"></iframe>\n```\n\n\n![Remote jobs Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services](./figures/Remote_jobs_Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.jpg){width=90% fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n```{=html}\n<iframe width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" src=\"./figures/top_industries.html\" title=\"Analyst Distribution (with Salaries)\"></iframe>\n```\n\n",
