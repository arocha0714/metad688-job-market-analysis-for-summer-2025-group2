# Introduction

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a technology that allows computers and machines to mimic human abilities such as learning, understanding, solving problems, making decisions, being creative, and operating independently (Stryker, 2024). Over the next several years, generative AI will become the main focus of AI researchers and enthusiasts. Generative AI is a type of technology that can produce original text, images, and videos. With the rising popularity of generative AI, many companies are faced with the question of how to walk the line between technological advancements and ethical responsibility. Advocates of AI claim that when implemented properly, AI can boost productivity, accelerate product development, and improve business decision-making. In 2024, the International Monetary Fund estimated that 40% of jobs around the world will be affected by AI. Tech experts hypothesize that industries and sectors such as cybersecurity, financial services, and manufacturing (Expert Panel, 2021) are likely to be affected. On the other hand, some argue that while job displacement is inevitable, AI will also create new jobs. According to Lee, Samanta, and Lee (2024), AI will not eliminate jobs but instead will reshape career structures. Even so, there are still job types that can be at risk of being replaced. An example of a high-risk job would be one that involves repetition and predictable tasks, such as telemarketing and a customer support specialist. On the other hand, the more resilient jobs are those that require emotional intelligence or creative problem-solving. Some examples of these careers are teachers, writers, and employees with skilled trades like plumbers. Another important aspect to consider is that there will be some jobs where AI is used in conjunction with their regular responsibilities; an example of this is teachers. Teachers may use AI to grade papers, but they still will need to perform their regular tasks, like lecturing and mentoring students. Overall, Lee, Samanta, and Lee (2024) conclude that the rise of AI has a twofold effect: potential job displacement and the creation of new opportunities. While there is still a lot of uncertainty about the future, they argue that AI can augment  




## Purpose
With this in mind, our research will look at the rising trends within different industries in regards to AI. Specifically, we will compare the differences between careers impacted by AI vs careers that are not. We will also examine which states have the most upcoming AI-related jobs by looking at the job postings dataset.
